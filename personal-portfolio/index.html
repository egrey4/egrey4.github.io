      <h2> Poetry Project "It Is My Day" </h2>
      <p>
In this project, I created a "flarf" poem based a google search of the last phrase I texted someone - which was "I'm feeling kinda tired". I then added a photo from a Google web search of this text, to which then coded a flarf poem website using html and css.

      <h3> Plaster Sculpture </h3>
      <p> In "Choose Yourself", I used chicken wire to create an armature dictating space and form. I then covered
        this form with fabric bandages coated in plaster of paris and a final layer of hand applied plaster.
