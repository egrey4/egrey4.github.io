      <h2> Poetry Project "It Is My Day" </h2>
      <p>
For this project, I wrote a "flarf" poem based a google search of the last phrase I texted someone - which was "I'm feeling kinda tired". I then found a photo from a Google web search of this text, and coded my own flarf poem website using html and css.

      <h3> Plaster Sculpture </h3>
      <p> In "Choose Yourself", I used chicken wire to create an armature with space and form. I covered
        this armature with fabric bandages coated in plaster of paris, and then a final layer of hand applied plaster.
